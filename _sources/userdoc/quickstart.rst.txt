Quick start
===========

*Please go quickly over* :numref:`introdata-label` *(Data) and*
:numref:`introsample-label` *(Sample) before you proceed with this section.*

Parsed tables
-------------

Tables :ref:`tables-W01_exp_main_parsed-label` and
:ref:`tables-E01_edu_main_parsed-label` are the main tables in the database. They
relate the id's of each entrepreneur to the companies where they worked (as
founders and/or employees) and their job title, as well as the educational
institutions they attended and the programs studied there. As well, these tables
list the starting and ending date at each place.

W01_exp_main_parsed
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A row in table :ref:`tables-W01_exp_main_parsed-label` can be read as:

*Person <ind_id> worked for firm <org_id> in a role described by <jt_raw_id>,
from <exp_sy> to <exp_ey>.*

Where the fields <ind_id>, <org_id> and <jt_raw_id> can be looked up in tables
:ref:`tables-F01_founders_info-label`, :ref:`tables-T01_org_concordance-label`
and :ref:`tables-W02_job_titles_raw_parsed-label`, respectively.

E01_edu_main_parsed
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Similarly, a row in table :ref:`tables-E01_edu_main_parsed-label` can
be read as:

*Person <ind_id> studied at <org_id> the program <edu_prg_id>, from <edu_sy>
to <edu_ey>.*

Where the fields <ind_id>, <org_id> and <edu_prg_id> can be looked up in tables
:ref:`tables-F01_founders_info-label`, :ref:`tables-T01_org_concordance-label`
and :ref:`tables-E03_edu_programs-label`, respectively.

.. note::
  The fields <org_id>, <jt_raw_id> and <edu_prg_id> are missing for some rows.
  That is the case when the entrepreneur reported her employer but not the job
  role, or a job role but not the employer (e.g., 'freelance'), or a university
  but not the study program.

Flat tables
-----------

Given the database structure, a typical analysis will involve combining and
merging multiple tables. To reduce such initial building costs, and to
facilitate initial data manipulation and exploration, we include a set of
ready-to-use tables that already combine the essential fields and indicators.

In the flat tables, :ref:`tables-U01_exp_flat-label` and
:ref:`tables-U02_edu_flat-label`, a row represents an
instance of an entrepreneur's work or educational experience, respectively.
Hence, each row contains an identifier for an entrepreneur, the organization that
she founded or where she worked/studied, the job role or study program,
the time spell and additional indicators whose construction would otherwise
require to merge one or more tables.

.. admonition:: Example:

  The rows of :ref:`tables-W01_exp_main_parsed-label`
  represent work experience entries. To know the entrepreneur name in any given
  row, this table must be merged with :ref:`tables-F01_founders_info-label`
  through the field *ind_id*. To query more complex data, such as the
  employer's sector, the table must be merged:

  #. with table :ref:`tables-T01_org_concordance-label` through *org_id*\, and
  #. with table :ref:`tables-T02_orbis_company_data-label` through *bvd_id*\.

  The flat tables already contain the results of such basic operations.

As well, the tables retain identifiers
that can be used to append further indicators in the future.

Other tables
------------

U03_entrepreneur_dyads
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This table allows to explore the relationship between entrepreneurs' shared past
(e.g., same schooling, same employer, similar jobs, etc.) and the probability that
they team up and co-found a start-up. To achieve this, the rows of
*U03_entrepreneur_dyads* contain distinct dyads (i.e., pairs) of entrepreneurs.
There are two types of dyads: observed and counterfactual. Observed dyads involve
two entrepreneurs that teamed up and co-founded a start-up in a given year.
By contrast, counterfactual dyads involve two entrepreneurs that founded two
different start-ups in a given year (and hence are not co-founders). The
rationale is that counterfactual dyads represent co-founding opportunities that
could have taken place, but did not.

Additionally, we narrow down the counterfactuals with additional restrictions.
We define counterfactuals dyads as composed by pairs of entrepreneurs that,
in a given year, founded different start-ups:

 #. in the same industry (using Crunchbase industry tags), or
 #. in the same sector (using the Orbis sector classification).

To use the set of all real and counterfactual dyads, use all the rows of
*U03_entrepreneur_dyads*. To limit the counterfactuals using the industry- or
sector-based restriction you can filter rows where *counterf_same_industry==1* or
*counterf_same_sector==1*\.

For reference, the number of **real** dyads is 329. The number of **counterfactual**
dyads under the broadest definition (i.e., pairs of entrepreneurs who founded
two different start-ups the same year) is 61,539. Using industry and sector
definitions, the number of counterfactuals are 5,792 and 11,468, respectively.

*See* :ref:`tables-U03_entrepreneur_dyads-label` *for the content of the table*

.. warning:: Please note that while nearly all start-ups have Crunchbase industry tags,
  not all companies in the Orbis dataset have a *sector*. Moreover, about 13%
  (n=159) of the start-ups in our dataset could not be matched to Orbis (e.g.,
  some Crunchbase-listed start-ups were not incorporated, some may not show up
  in Orbis due to their vintage and some may not be matched because their
  trade and incorporation names differ significantly or are different altogether).
  As a result, *sector* data is missing for 15% (n=186) start-ups and, by
  construction, counterfactual dyads involving these firms are automatically
  dropped under the sector-based definition.

The *be_founders* dashboard
---------------------------

We are working on a dashboard that allows to explore part of the existing tables
and data. It is accessible `here <https://befoundersdyads.herokuapp.com/>`_.
