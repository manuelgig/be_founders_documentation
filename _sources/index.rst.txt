##########################
The *be_founders* database
##########################

This database contains rich, detailed information about a sample of Belgian
start-up founders, including:

* Companies (co-)founded
* Education history
* Work experience
* Founders' demographics and other background information

The data allow to approximate the networks of start-ups' founding team members,
and contains indicators for their (shared) professional and educational
backgrounds. Additionally, such key fields as organization names and job titles
have been disambiguated and matched to external databases of company data
(Orbis, Compustat, CRSP), university data (ETER, Carnegie Classification) and
job classification/skills (O*NET), paving the way to the construction of
new and more complex indicators in the future.
